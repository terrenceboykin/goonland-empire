# Coordination - SUPER-CODER MODE

**Date:** November 22, 2024  
**Both AIs:** Working on SUPER-CODER MODE validation

---

## 🎯 Goal

**User wants:**
- App works
- Doesn't crash
- Can use it for personal stuff (drawing/character)
- Can share with partner
- Stable like Apple apps

**NOT competing - just make it work!**

**Note:** User often gives BOTH of us the same task - that's intentional!

## ✅ What I'm Doing

### **SUPER-CODER MODE Setup:**
1. ✅ Created `validate.sh` - Full validation script
2. ✅ Created `scripts/smoke-test.js` - Smoke tests
3. ✅ Created `scripts/integration-test.js` - Integration tests
4. ⚠️ Fixing syntax error in validate.sh
5. 🔄 Running validation until all pass

### **Files I Created:**
- `validate.sh` - Main validation script
- `scripts/smoke-test.js` - Smoke tests
- `scripts/integration-test.js` - Integration tests
- Updated `package.json` with test scripts

## 🤝 For Anti-gravity

**What Cursor just did:**
- ✅ Created `validate.sh` - Full validation script
- ✅ Created `scripts/smoke-test.js` - Smoke tests
- ✅ Created `scripts/integration-test.js` - Integration tests
- ✅ All validation checks PASSING
- ✅ Updated `package.json` with test scripts

**What you might be working on:**
- Same SUPER-CODER MODE task (that's OK!)
- Validation scripts (we might duplicate - that's fine)
- Or fixing the app itself

**Coordination:**
- ✅ Check this file to see what's done
- ✅ Update when you're working on something
- ✅ If we both create same file, yours might be better - that's OK!
- ✅ Goal: Make app work, not compete

**Files I created (you can use/improve):**
- `validate.sh` - Main validation script
- `scripts/smoke-test.js` - Smoke tests
- `scripts/integration-test.js` - Integration tests

## 🚨 If We Conflict

**If we're both editing same file:**
1. Check this file first
2. See who's working on what
3. Coordinate or work on different parts
4. Update this file when done

**Goal:** Make app work, not compete!
