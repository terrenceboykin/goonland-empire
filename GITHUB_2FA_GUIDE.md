# GitHub 2FA - Which Code to Use?

**You're seeing TWO different codes - here's what they are:**

## 🔍 The Two Codes Explained

### **1. GitHub's 6-Digit Code (6 X's)**
- **What it is:** 6-digit verification code
- **Where it comes from:**
  - Your phone (SMS text message)
  - Authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
- **Format:** `123456` (6 digits)
- **This is what you need!**

### **2. Google's 8-Character Code (with letters)**
- **What it is:** Backup code or app password
- **Where it comes from:** Google account settings
- **Format:** `abcd-1234` or `abcd1234` (8 characters, letters + numbers)
- **This is NOT for GitHub!** This is for Google services

## ✅ What to Do

### **Step 1: Use GitHub's 6-Digit Code**

1. **Check your phone** for a text message from GitHub
   - Should have a 6-digit code
   - Example: `123456`

2. **OR check your authenticator app**
   - Open Google Authenticator, Authy, or similar
   - Find "GitHub" in the list
   - Get the 6-digit code

3. **Enter that 6-digit code** in GitHub's prompt

### **Step 2: Ignore Google's Code**

- The 8-character code from Google is NOT for GitHub
- That's for Google services
- You can ignore it for now
