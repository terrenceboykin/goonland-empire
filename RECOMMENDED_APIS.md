# The "Empire" API Shopping List (Use Your $1,300 Credits)

You are right—enable everything you might use. They only charge when you use it, and you have credits to burn.

## 1. MUST-HAVE for "Chieftamate" (The App)

These are critical to kill Xactimate. **Enable these first.**

* **Solar API:** (The "Eyes") - **CRITICAL.** Measures roof pitch, sun, shade, and size from space.
* **Maps JavaScript API:** Shows the satellite map on the screen so the user sees their house.
* **Places API:** Allows the "Address Autocomplete" (so they type "123 M..." and it fills "123 Main St").
* **Geocoding API:** Converts "123 Main St" into GPS coordinates for the satellite.
* **Weather API:** **YES.** Essential for "Date of Loss" verification (proving the storm happened).
* **Cloud Vision API:** **YES.** Kirsta is right. Good for detecting specific damage types (hail vs. blister) in close-up photos.

## 2. MUST-HAVE for "Your Life" (The Personal Assistant)

Since you want "The Chief" to help *you* (Terrence), enable these so we can build automation later:

* **Gmail API:** "Chief, read my emails and find the invoices."
* **Google Calendar API:** "Chief, schedule a meeting with Kirsta."
* **Gmail API:** "Chief, read my emails and find the invoices."
* **Google Calendar API:** "Chief, schedule a meeting with Kirsta."

* **Gmail API:** "Chief, read my emails and find the invoices."
* **Google Calendar API:** "Chief, schedule a meeting with Kirsta."
* **Gmail API:** "Chief, read my emails and find the invoices."

## 3. Logistics & Efficiency (The Fleet Manager)

You asked about Navigation and Routes. **YES.** This turns the app into a Dispatch System.

* **Address Validation API:** **YES.** Stops your guys from driving to the wrong "123 Main St."
* **Route Optimization API:** **HUGE YES.** If you have 5 estimates today, this tells you the perfect order to hit them to save gas and time.
* **Distance Matrix API:** **YES.** Calculates "Trip Charges." (e.g., "Job is 50 miles away, add $100 fuel surcharge").
* **Directions API / Routes API:** **YES.** In-app navigation for your crews.
* **Maps Static API:** **YES.** Essential for the PDF Report. It takes a "screenshot" of the map to put on the paper estimate.
* **Street View Static API:** **YES.** Puts a photo of the front of the house on the cover page of the PDF.
